Exploration rovers dispatched  to celestial bodies  such as the Moon and Mars  encounter significant  mobility challenges, particularly when navigating through soft soil and rocky terrains. The  wheels of these  rovers  often lose  traction and sink  into soft terrain , leading  to risk the permanent  entrapment . This presents  a formidable  obstacle  to continued  exploration and scientific discovery.

Enhancement:
Leveraging advanced simulation  method wheel  for wheel-terrain interactions , we aim to design wheels that consider uncertainties  and compare results and compare results  with deterministic  operations . Includes  study  of optimal wheels  dimensions , the eventual longitudinal slip of rover and desired mass of  the payload

Applications:
An analytical approach to grouser design  that takes into account  the impact of uncertainties  the grouser simulation on  traction efficiency .This involves  the development of a statistical estimation of soil  parameters and the implementation of  reconfigurable wheels
